Description: Penumbra is a mathematically balanced colour scheme 
    constructed in a perceptually uniform colour space with base 
    colours inspired by the shades of colour occuring in nature 
    due to the light of the sun and the sky. It cleanly separates 
    the perceptual properties of colours while optimally utilising 
    the available colour space of typical displays.
