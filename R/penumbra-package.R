#' Penumbra - a palette inspired by nature
#'
#' This imports Neal McKee's penumbra package, available at
#' <https://github.com/nealmckee/penumbra>.
#' [base_pal()] returns grayscale-ish base colors from dark to light.
#' [color_pal()] returns "rainbow"-style colors.
#'
#' Note that these palettes are not suitable for people with colourblindness.
#' So, only use them for your own exploratory work, not for producing display
#' graphics that other people have to see.
